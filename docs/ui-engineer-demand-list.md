# DIS UI engineer demand list (dis-ui-server endpoints)

**Status:** RECONSTRUCTION, v0.2, 2026-06-03. The original demand list was lost (never committed; authored in-chat). This is a faithful rebuild, not the original.

**Provenance.** Synthesized from in-repo and recovered sources:
- the DIS UI Surface Map v1.0 (per-screen endpoint dependencies, data, and actions),
- the recovered `openapi-dis-ui-backend.yaml` v0.1.0 conventions and the onboarding shapes (the only shapes recovered verbatim),
- `docs/architecture.md` section 4.17 (the dis-ui-server handler set),
- the slice 19 `GET /me` shape (`services/dis-ui/src/lib/dis-ui-server/`).

**Every request and response shape here is PROVISIONAL** unless marked RECOVERED. The canonical sources to reconcile against are the original OpenAPI spec if it resurfaces and `docs/decisions.md` D25 (Customer Master claim vocabulary, still open). Where the surface map used older paths (`POST /uploads`), this doc uses the recovered `/v1/` convention.

**Naming note.** The BFF was `dis-api` in the surface map and the recovered spec; it is now `dis-ui-server` (commit `4c6a044`). Paths are unchanged; the service name is updated here.

---

## 0. Conventions

- **Auth.** Every endpoint takes a Customer Master Bearer JWT (RECOVERED). dis-ui-server verifies signature against JWKS, extracts `tenant_id` and role claims, and enforces RBAC at the handler level (arch 4.17).
- **Scope tags.** T = tenant-scoped (RLS to the caller's `tenant_id`). P = platform/ops only. T+P = both, with ops able to cross-tenant via a `tenant_id` filter.
- **Paths.** `/v1/<group>/<resource>` (RECOVERED).
- **Errors (RECOVERED).** Standard `Error` body; `RateLimited` (429, `Retry-After`); `Backpressure` (downstream unhealthy, DLQ above threshold, `Retry-After`).
- **Events referenced (RECOVERED).** `ingress.ready`, `ingress.resubmit`, `quarantine`, `pipeline.dlq`, `mapping.changed`, `identity.changed`.
- **Lineage.** `trace_id`, `parent_trace_id` on resubmits; every canonical row carries `mapping_version_id` (decisions.md D22).
- **RBAC vocabulary.** The token carries a `roles` array in a `dis:<capability>` namespace (`dis:upload`, `dis:read`, `dis:ops`, `dis:mapping_admin`) - the provisional values from Sanjeev's slice-2 Customer Master fake (`libs/dis-testing` fixtures) and `contracts/identity-service/attribute-needs.md`, pending D25. There is no `user_type` claim; the tenant-vs-ops split is the `dis:ops` role. Phase 1 gates on the `dis:ops` role and `tenant_id` only - no screen gates on fine-grained permissions.
- **Identifiers.** Canonical ids are external strings: tenant `t_*`, store `s_*`, user `u_*` (Sanjeev's fixtures). The external<->internal-UUID translation location is OPEN (`docs/decisions.md` D37, hard deadline Slice 7). Older example payloads below that still show `ten_*` / `usr_*` ids are stale provisional illustrations to reconcile.

## 1. Cross-cutting

### 1.1 GET /v1/me  ·  scope T+P  ·  screens: all (AuthBoundary, header)
The signed-in user's display profile for the authenticated session. This is a profile call, distinct from authz: identity and authz come from the token claims (`sub`, `tenant_id`, `store_id`, `roles`), which the UI decodes locally. The profile fields below are NOT token claims; they come from a separate dis-ui-server to Customer Master call (`contracts/identity-service/attribute-needs.md` routes user email/name/display fields there).
Response (PROVISIONAL profile shape; email and name are UI-dev fixtures with no source in Sanjeev's repo):
```jsonc
{
  "user_id": "u_acmeuser0001",
  "email": "acme.user@example.test",
  "name": "Acme User",
  "tenant_id": "t_acme9k2l1mn4",     // null for ops (cross-tenant)
  "tenant_name": "Acme Retail"       // null for ops; server-side display join
}
```
Open: arch 4.17 lists no `/me` handler, so whether dis-ui-server exposes this profile call (vs. another shape) is OPEN, pending Sanjeev and slice 13. Authz never depends on it - the UI gates on the token's `roles` and `tenant_id`. (See dis-ui-server-contract.md.)

### 1.2 GET /v1/dashboard/summary  ·  scope T (ops via tenant switch)  ·  screen: Tenant Dashboard
Per-tenant at-a-glance: last submission per source, quarantined counts, active source count, recent latency snapshot.
Response (PROVISIONAL):

### 2.5 POST /v1/onboarding/samples/{sample_id}/approve  ·  scope T+P  ·  screen: Mapping Review
Write the mapping to `config.source_mappings` with `status='staged'`; starts shadow rollout. Response: `{ "source_id": "...", "mapping_version": N, "status": "staged" }`.

### 2.6 GET /v1/sources/{source_id}/shadow-stats  ·  scope T+P  ·  screen: Shadow Rollout Review (Phase 2)
Rollup of the staged-window output: window, input chunks, staged rows, validation pass rate, diff-vs-active counts.

### 2.7 GET /v1/sources/{source_id}/shadow-diff  ·  scope T+P  ·  screen: Shadow Rollout Review (Phase 2)
Sample diff rows (staged vs current active). Query: `limit`.

### 2.8 POST /v1/sources/{source_id}/promote  ·  scope T+P  ·  screen: Shadow Rollout Review (Phase 2)

### 3.4 POST /v1/sources/{source_id}/mappings/{version}/deprecate  ·  scope P  ·  screen: Mapping Versions

## 4. Quarantine

### 4.1 GET /v1/quarantine  ·  scope T+P  ·  screen: Quarantine Console

Search audit events. Query: `tenant_id` (ops), `store_id`, `source_id`, `from`, `to`, `status`, `mapping_version_id`. Returns the result list; clicking a row loads 5.1.

---

Per-user query history (last 10).

---

## 8. Build sequencing

### 8.1 Minimum set already consumed (slice 19)
`GET /v1/me` only. Slice 19 wired the fixture client around it.

### 8.2 Phase 1 / slice 20 fixture set (the five MVP screens)
The endpoints whose fixtures slice 20 must ship:
- Sample Upload: 2.1, 2.2
- Mapping Review: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
- Mapping Versions (read-only): 3.1, 3.2
- Quarantine Console (tenant, read + detail): 4.1, 4.2
- Audit & Trace Lookup (trace_id direct): 5.1
Plus cross-cutting already present: 1.1, and 1.3 for source context.

### 8.3 Recommended grouping for Sanjeev's slices 15 to 17
This is a recommendation, not a decision. Sanjeev owns the real cut.
- **Slice 15 (cross-cutting + onboarding):** 1.1 to 1.6, 2.1 to 2.9. The onboarding flow end to end plus session and source registry. Highest UI dependency.
- **Slice 16 (mapping CRUD + quarantine):** 3.1 to 3.4, 4.1 to 4.4. The two heaviest tenant workflows after onboarding.
- **Slice 17 (audit + notifications + ops):** 5.1 to 5.2, 6.1 to 6.4, 7.1 to 7.5. Cross-tenant and ops surfaces, plus the notification plumbing.

## 9. Open questions and reconciliation

1. **GET /me existence.** Arch 4.17 lists no `/me` handler. Confirm whether dis-ui-server exposes 1.1, or whether the UI derives identity from token claims. Pending Sanjeev and slice 13.
2. **RBAC vocabulary.** Authz is a `roles` array in a `dis:<capability>` namespace (`dis:upload`, `dis:read`, `dis:ops`, `dis:mapping_admin`) - the provisional values from Sanjeev's slice-2 fake and `attribute-needs.md`, pending D25. There is no `user_type`; the tenant-vs-ops split is the `dis:ops` role. The recovered surface map section 6.2 used an admin-frontend-style 4-tuple; D25 settles which is canonical.
6. **External id vs UUID (D37).** Ids are external strings (`t_*` / `s_*` / `u_*`); the DB keys by UUID. The translation location is OPEN (`docs/decisions.md` D37, Slice 7 deadline). Stale `ten_*` / `usr_*` ids in some example payloads predate this and should be read as illustrative only.
7. **Profile call.** `email`, `name`, and `tenant_name` (1.1) are not token claims; they come from a separate dis-ui-server to Customer Master profile call that is itself OPEN. The specific fixture values are UI-dev placeholders, not from Sanjeev's sources.
3. **Path and shape drift.** Only the onboarding shapes (2.1, 2.2) are RECOVERED verbatim. Everything else is derived from the surface map's documented data and actions and must be checked against the original OpenAPI spec if it resurfaces, or against Sanjeev's slice 15 to 17 implementation, whichever lands first.
4. **Sources grouping.** The surface map treats Sources as a screen adjacent to Mapping CRUD; this doc folds the source endpoints (1.3 to 1.6) into cross-cutting because the dashboard and onboarding both read them. Confirm grouping with Sanjeev.
5. **Endpoint count.** The lost original was described as 26 endpoints across 7 groups. This rebuild lands near that across the same 7 groups; exact parity with the original is not claimed.
```
